we have two players on left side and right side.
And the goal of the game is to get to 100 points first. 
in each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes
 and each result gets added to his round score. 
But if a player rolls a 1 on dice he will lose his round score.
But in order to avoid that, the player can choose to hold.
Which means that his round score gets added to his global score.
And after that, it's again the next player's turn.And the first player to then reach 100 points on the
global score wins the game.
